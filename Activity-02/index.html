            Once upon a time there was a <strong>Chinese farmer</strong> whose horse ran away. All the neighbours came around that evening and said, <em>“That’s too bad.”</em> 
        </p>

        <p>
            And the farmer said, “Maybe.” The next day the horse came back and brought seven <mark>wild horses</mark> with it. And all the neighbours came around and said, <cite>“That’s great, isn’t it?”</cite> And the farmer said, “Maybe.”
        </p> 

        <p>
            he next day his son, who was attempting to tame one of these horses, and was riding it and was thrown broke his leg. And all the <del>neighbours</del><ins>friends</ins> came around in the evening and said, <abbr title ="CS 140 Activity 2 by Adarsh"></abbr> “Well, that’s too bad, isn’t it?” And the farmer said, “Maybe.”
            
            <q>The next day the conscription officers came around looking for people for the army</q>. They <b>rejected</b> his son because he had a broken leg. And all the neighbours came around that evening and said, “Well, isn’t that wonderful?” And the farmer said, “Maybe.”
